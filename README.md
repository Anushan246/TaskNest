## 💡 How It Works

- **Add Tasks:** Enter your task, set its priority, and (optionally) mark it as important with a password.
- **Remove/Delete Tasks:** Move tasks to the recycle bin. Important tasks require a password to delete.
- **Restore Tasks:** Bring back deleted tasks from the recycle bin.
- **Stay Organized:** Filter by priority, mark as completed, and track your progress.
